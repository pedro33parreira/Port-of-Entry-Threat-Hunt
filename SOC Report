What Happened

An external attacker accessed AZUKI-SL via exposed RDP using Administrator credentials.
They executed malicious binaries, installed persistence, and navigated internal systems.
Sensitive supply contracts and pricing documentation were compressed and exfiltrated.

The stolen documents were later observed on underground forums.

Impact Assessment
Business Impact

Contract loss

Pricing strategy exposed

Commercial intelligence compromise

Risk Level

HIGH

Business confidential data was leaked externally.

Root Cause Analysis
Category	Root
Access Control	No MFA on RDP
Exposure	Public RDP
Credential Hygiene	Admin reuse
Monitoring	No anomaly alert
Network	Unrestricted egress
Recommendations
Immediate

Disable external RDP

Reset Admin credentials

Isolate AZUKI-SL

Reimage the device

Short Term

Enforce MFA

Enable RDP alerts

Lock down admin privileges

Reduce outbound access

Long Term

SIEM deployment

Zero Trust architecture

Network segmentation

EDR policy hardening

Detection Improvements
Category	Improvement
Process Monitoring	Alert on Admin powershell
Network	Monitor abnormal HTTPS
Persistence	Registry alerts
Login	Geo anomaly detection
Final Verdict

This was a deliberate cyber-espionage incident, not user error or accidental exposure.

The attacker:

Exploited exposed access

Stole high-value documents

Enabled persistence

Exfiltrated data

Left without triggering alarms

Incident Status

✅ Closed
✅ Management notified
✅ Forensics preserved
✅ Remediation underway
